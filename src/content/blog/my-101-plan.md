title: My 101 plan
description: Three years ago, I first started in this field. Now, after all this time, I want to review everything Iâ€™ve learned and create a reference for myself and anyone else. Hereâ€™s the plan Iâ€™ll be following.

Before we dive into any plan, we need to set clear goals, Actually, SMART goals. So, what does SMART stand for?

- **S** â†’ Specific
- **M** â†’ Measurable
- **A** â†’ Achievable
- **R** â†’ Relevant
- **T** â†’ Time-bound    

Now, instead of just talking about it, letâ€™s apply this framework to our goal. Weâ€™ll check if itâ€™s already SMART, and if not, weâ€™ll adjust it until it is.

## My goals

In this phase of my journey, I want to focus on one thing and become really good at it. Iâ€™ve learned many things and explored many programming languages, but now itâ€™s time to master just one. Alongside that, I need to review everything Iâ€™ve learned so far and turn it into a small reference because right now, most of it is only in my head or scattered across the sources I learned from. As for big projects, I think Iâ€™ll put that idea aside for now and instead spend more time solving problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com).

**Summary of the goals:**

- Master one programming language
- Solve [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) problems
- Review everything Iâ€™ve learned
    - Create a personal reference
- (Later) Build one big project

### Letâ€™s apply the SMART framework

**Master one programming language:**  
This goal isnâ€™t SMART yet, but why?  
I know it sounds like a good goal, but:

- Whatâ€™s the language Iâ€™ll master?
- How do I know Iâ€™ve reached 50% or 100% of it?
- Yes, itâ€™s achievable, but how do we measure progress?
- Itâ€™s relevant because I want to get better at what I do, not just search every time I need something.
- And finally, we havenâ€™t set a deadline.

Letâ€™s fix that using the SMART framework:

- **Specific:** Choose a language. For now, Iâ€™ll pick **Python** for reasons Iâ€™ll explain later.
- **Measurable:** Follow a clear roadmap to see what Iâ€™ve already covered and whatâ€™s left.
- **Achievable:** Itâ€™s absolutely doable, I can master it with focused effort.
- **Relevant:** It fits perfectly with my current journey, since I need one strong language to rely on.
- **Time-bound:** Given that Iâ€™ve already learned multiple languages, including Python, Iâ€™ll set a deadline of **two weeks** to complete the roadmap.

> Iâ€™m not going to break down every goal like this, Iâ€™ll just make it come naturally while planning. Weâ€™ll shape each goal into a SMART one as we go.


## The Plan  
First, letâ€™s set a deadline, since we already know our goals. Iâ€™m giving this plan 2 months. We can always adjust it later if life gets in the way.  
  
First month:  
Master Python using roadmap.sh â†’ 2 weeks.  
Solve 200 easy problems on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com) (not related to DSA) â†’ 2 weeks.  
  
Second month:  
  
Review everything Iâ€™ve learned so far, based on [Ahmed Metwallyâ€™s backend roadmap](https://metwallylabs.com/backendroadmap.html). This will take about 1 month since I already know the material, the main goal here is to write it down and turn it into a proper reference.  
  
I know itâ€™s a simple plan for now and not perfect, but Iâ€™ll keep improving it as I go, until I reach the point where I can build a big project without needing to search for every little thing.  
  
The more detailed weekly breakdown will be in my Notion workspace, so I can track progress and stay on schedule.  
  
Thanks for your time, have a great day ðŸ‘‹
