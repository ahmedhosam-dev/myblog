# Hello, world
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```
This was the first progam i have ever made in my life.

Like you see this was very simple seems like python is programming language for kids.

but even it's so easy its so useful too cause it's used in many industry (AI, Game, Data, Desktop, Mobile, Web, ...)

That's why i love python.

i know it looks like a lovely language but its slow in big projects if you don't know how to optimize you code and your logic.
